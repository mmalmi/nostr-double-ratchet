# Changelog

## 0.0.100 - 2026-04-26

- Mirror the runtime-owned direct-message subscription architecture in the TypeScript package.
- Add fed-event `Session.receiveEvent(...)` and `SessionManager.processReceivedEvent(...)` paths for external relay dispatch.
- Have `NdrRuntime` subscribe to current direct-message authors and resubscribe when ratchet/session state changes.
- Add TypeScript runtime coverage for direct messages delivered through `NdrRuntime`.

## 0.0.99 - 2026-04-26

- Move direct-message subscription ownership from `Session`/`SessionManager` into `NdrRuntime`.
- Keep `Session` focused on ratchet state and encryption/decryption; callers now feed received events through runtime/manager APIs.
- Speed up `ndr listen` startup by removing the redundant filesystem watcher path and flushing runtime subscriptions immediately.
- Fix shared-channel group invite acceptance so accepted sessions are imported into `SessionManager` before follow-up messages.
- Tighten group-listener e2e coverage so a single group send must reach every other participant.

## 0.0.98 - 2026-04-26

- Preserve original inner rumor IDs when queued session-manager publishes flush later.
- Surface queued publish metadata through Rust and FFI event streams so apps can attach relay ACKs to the original queued chat message.
- Add regression coverage for queued publish metadata preservation across setup and retry flows.
